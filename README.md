## TAILS & WHISKERS - Dog & Cat food eCommerce website

## Overview
Third project for GA bootcamp as part of a team, building a Full-Stack MERN Application and adapting the skills of newly learnt technologies like MongoDB and Express. We decided to build an Ecommerce website highly inspired by Butternut Box website. We wanted to buid a famcy dog an cat food shop that would allow authenticated users to purchase dog and cat food or view products that are currently in stock.

Deployed version can be found [here](https://tailsandwhisters.herokuapp.com/)

To test authenticated user you may register with a test user or use ``aaim@email.com`` and password ``pass``

## Installation 

+ Clone repo or download zip 
+ Run ``yarn dev`` and head to ``localhost:4000`` to view the site



## Brief
As a group, create a Fullstack application with CRUD functionality using the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express, React & Node.

## Technologies used
+ React
+ Javascript
+ Express
+ Node.js
+ Sass
+ Bootstrap / React Bootstrap
+ MongoDB
+ Mongoose
+ Axios
+ JWT
+ Git / GitHub

## Approach
We have spent whole two days in deciding on an idea as well as planning our project with building wireframes, flowchards of user journey as well as user stories for the project. It definitely have helped us to be organised knowing exacly what features we are building and when. Here are our flowchart and initial wireframes for the project. <br>

### Backend
We decided to be spending a few days building the backend all together before we moved to the front-end and split out to built feature by feature. It all ran smoothly as we were taking turns in writting code while there others would figure out the logic for it. It was a great way for each of us to go through the backend together and solidity the knowledge of backend.

### Front-End
#### Features I worked on
+ Basket modal
+ Homepage 
+ About Page
+ Styling retouching 
+ Pet Profile page
+ Navbar 


## Challenges
+ Figure out relationships required for our application has been pretty challenging. We decided to keep our database pretty simple so our backend isn't too complicated. Here is our initial relationships in our database.

## Wins
+ Fool proof planning as part of a team. We have done a great job at planning out the project and spending significant amount of time in making wireframes as well as user stories. Working as part of a 4 people team could have been more challenging, but we were well organised with daily standups that we would discuss what features we are building on the day and how we will be working during the day (individually, pair coding, part of a group).
+ After spending a whole day collaboratively tackling the problem of building a basket component and trying many different revenues Ajun managed to figure out the logic for it. It has been a greta win to be working collaboratively together to try and tackle the hardest feature to build on the project together, it does definitely need some more improvements but we were happy with the finished version of this feature.
+ As it was the first time working as part of a four person team on one project and single code base, we had to imbrace using Git to our advanage and start working on our own individual branches. As we chose to build backend all together we saved time and efforts and had to start working with branches when we moved to build our own seperate features. We would start our morning deciding on whos gonna be building what features, push our changes to devewlopement branch and pull most up to date code and repeat the process at the end of the day making sure we save ourseveles the headache with major merge conflicts. 


## Bugs
+ You are able to checkout the basket even if you are not authenticated.
+ Popup message appear twcie when something gets added or removed from the basket.
+ Token doesn't get cleared from local storage corrently, which causes the basket items stay in the basket if it hasn't been checked out.


## Key Learnings
+ Bootstrap Framework. First time using other CSS Framework that wasn't Bulma. I personally really enjoyed working with Bootstrap, which at the beginning was a bit scary and I couldn't wrap my head around it, but it was a great starting point in this project to get more comfortable with another framework and to continue using it in future projects.
+ MongoDB and working with NoSQL database for the first time. It was great to get to work building a first database and adapt the knowledge learnn by building a MongoDB database.
+ Project planning and working as part of a team. It has been a great experience working on a first team project. Learning how to organise the workflow and different tasks.
